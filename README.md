# IT Incident Resolution & KPI Analytics

## Project Overview

This project analyzes IT incident data to evaluate operational efficiency and service quality.
The analysis focuses on incident resolution performance, SLA compliance, and incident reopen behavior
using Python and Pandas.

## Dataset Summary

- Total Incidents Analyzed: 24,918
- Time Period: February 2016 – March 2017
- Original Data Level: Event-level incident logs
- Final Analysis Level: Incident-level (aggregated per INC)

## KPIs Analyzed

- Average Resolution Time (in hours)
- Average Closure Time (in hours)
- SLA Compliance (%)
- Reopen Rate (%)

## Analysis Performed

- Cleaned and standardized datetime columns
- Aggregated event-level logs to incident-level records
- Calculated resolution and closure time KPIs
- Evaluated SLA compliance and incident reopen behavior
- Performed monthly trend analysis on key metrics

## Key Insights

- Incident volumes showed significant variation across months
- Resolution and closure times differed notably during high-volume periods
- SLA compliance fluctuated over time, indicating periods of operational strain
- Reopen rate remained relatively low, suggesting acceptable resolution quality
